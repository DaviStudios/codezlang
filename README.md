![**CodeZlang**](more/logo.png)

CodeZlang is an funny, basic programming language made in Python. It uses the GenZ Slang as its syntax, example:
"
lit a be hello rn
lit b be world rn
say <<a>>|<<b>>
"
or
lit a be hello|world rn
say <<a>> rn

**some info:**
CodeZlang doesn't support spaces in strings etc, so for example, "say hello world rn" won't work, however, "say hello|world rn" will.
Make sure EVERY LINE ends with an "rn" keyword.

**keywords:**
**lit** -- variable declaration, example: lit a be sup|yall rn
**say** -- printing function, example: say sup|yall rn
**rand** -- random number, example: rand do (variable name to store the result) 1 100
**do** -- do something, mostly used in functions like rand
**be** -- declarator, mostly used in declarations like lit
**rn** -- line ender
